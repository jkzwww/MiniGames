The HURKLE is a happy beast that lives on the planet Lirht that has 3 moons.
Hurkles are the favourite pets of the Gwik who live on Lirht.

To capture one, you must enter 2 co-ordinates,
each from 0-9 using the XY format (X = North/South, Y = East/West).
You will be told how accurate your aim was.

You have just 5 shots to find the HURKLE!
Good luck.
