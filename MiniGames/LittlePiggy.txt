Little Piggy :: A Simple Dice Game
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Little Piggy is a very simple dice game for two players. 

The game is played in a series of turns.
The aim of the game is to be the first player to score
the target score.

On your turn you may keep rolling the die,
scoring points for each 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 rolled.

After any roll you can decide to "bank" your score.
This is added to your current score and ends your turn.

However, if you roll a 1, then you score nothing for this 
turn and play passes to the next player.

The winner is the first player to reach or exceed;
the target score is usually 100 points.
