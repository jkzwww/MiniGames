 How to Play Even Minus Odd

A simple game that uses 6 dice for 2 or more players using "counters" for scoring.
The starting "counter pool" has 10-20 x the number of players counters in it.
On your turn:
* You roll all 6 dice.
* Total all even numbers then subtract the odd numbers.
* Take the resulting number of counters from the pool.
* If the result is negative, pay that many counters to
 the pool OR all your counters if you are short.
You are not out of the game if you have no counters, as you may gain some on your next turn.
The game ends when all the counters in the pool are taken.
The winner is the player with the most counters.
